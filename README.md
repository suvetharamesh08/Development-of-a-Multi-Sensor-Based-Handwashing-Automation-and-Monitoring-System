📌 Project Overview

The Arduino-Based Smart Hand Washing System is an embedded systems project designed to improve hand hygiene through automatic water pump control and environmental temperature monitoring.

The system uses an IR sensor to detect hand presence, an LDR sensor to identify light conditions, a relay module to control the water pump, and a DHT11 sensor to monitor temperature. A buzzer provides an alert when the temperature reaches the configured threshold.

⚙️ Working Principle

The system operates through the following steps:

1. Hand Detection

- The IR sensor continuously detects the presence of a hand.

- When a hand is detected, the sensor sends a LOW signal (assuming an active-LOW IR module).

- Arduino checks the LDR condition before activating the water pump.

2. Light Detection

- The LDR sensor detects the surrounding light intensity.

- The Arduino reads the digital output of the LDR module.

- The system identifies the light condition based on the sensor output.

3. Automatic Water Pump Control

- When both hand detection and the required light condition are satisfied, Arduino activates the relay.

- The relay switches ON the water pump.

- Water flows for approximately 3 seconds.

- After 3 seconds, the relay switches OFF the pump.

- The system waits for the hand to be removed before accepting another detection.

4. Temperature Monitoring

- The DHT11 sensor measures the surrounding temperature.

- Arduino reads the temperature using the DHT library.

- The temperature value is displayed in the Serial Monitor.

5. Buzzer Alert

- The measured temperature is compared with the predefined threshold.

- When the temperature reaches or exceeds the threshold, the buzzer is activated.

- Otherwise, the buzzer remains OFF.
